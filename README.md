Clean water consumption by urban poor households directly affects their wellbeing and ability to escape the trap of poverty. UNICEF declares that 78 million Nigerian children suffer from poor water access, and are at risk of water-related crises. Unfortunately, urban poor households are not connected to Water Distribution Network (WDN), which makes it difficult to measure the volume of water consumed. This study aims to model and evaluate volume of water consumed by urban poor households and determine whether it meets Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) standards. It experiments with four machine learning models, and an integration of geospatial and non-geospatial data. Specifically, the study explores the combination of geospatial technology and machine learning techniques to model and evaluate water consumption, examine the influence of geospatial features on ability of urban poor households to meet WASH standards, and assess impact of seasonal temperature variability on volume of water consumed.
